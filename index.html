 <h1>The Best Thing I Have Read Recently Gabe Oldenhof</h1>
    <p>The best thing I have read recently was an article on Michael Schumacher. This is because of how much Formula 1 means to my family. <br> 
    Michael Schumacher is my fathers favourite racing driver so it meant a lot reading his accomplishments. The article discusses Michael's record 7 F1 World Championships.<br>
    Another one of his greatest accomplishments is his 100% podium rate in the 2002 F1 season. Reading about his accomplishments  </p>
    <p>When I was reading this article it was almost like reliving the stories my father told me about the legend of Michael Schumacher. <br>
    Michael Schumacher's passion for Formula 1 is truly inspiring and after reading the article I understand why he is regarded as the greatest <br>
Formula 1 driver of all time.</p>
